SYSTEMS MONITOR TROUBLESHOOTING

1) "connection refused" when API/Sampler tries DB
- Inside docker network, Postgres is on port 5432.
- Fix api/sampler env: DB_HOST=db, DB_PORT=5432.

2) "password authentication failed for user postgres"
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD must match DB_PASSWORD.
- If you changed passwords but reused the old volume:
  docker compose down -v
  docker compose up --build

3) Dashboard doesn't auto-refresh
- Auto-refresh only runs when mode=latest.
- Open browser console: look for JS errors.
- Confirm API returns non-500 responses.

4) Chart repeats the same time label
- If labels are only to the second, repeated points can share the same label.
- Deduplicate by row.id before pushing to the buffer.
- Or increase timestamp precision (only if desired).

5) Range mode tables/charts not updating
- Make sure updateChartsRange(points) exists if dashboard.js calls it.
- Verify /api/range returns points and is not empty.
